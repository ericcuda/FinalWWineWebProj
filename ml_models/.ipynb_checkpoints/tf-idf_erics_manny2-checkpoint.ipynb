    "Manny:  But if you are interested in other things you can do, you can use the wine description text to model the topics in your dataset. We didn’t cover this but there is a good presentation that covers the Latent Direchlet Algorithm which can group words in the text into a pre-defined set of topics (you supply the number of topics). You will probably see things like white wine separated from red but could be interesting to how other words get grouped. The presentation below uses a couple of packages we ddn’t discuss in class like gensim and the code in his presentation uses Python 2, but something more you could do with the data\n",
